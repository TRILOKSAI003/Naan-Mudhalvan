Sentiment Analysis
This project explores sentiment analysis, a technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) used to determine the emotional tone of text. It can classify opinions and feelings within text data as positive, negative, or neutral.

Getting Started
This project requires the following:

Python (version X.X or higher) - https://www.python.org/downloads/
Libraries (install using pip):
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn (or other machine learning library)
NLTK (optional, for advanced text processing)
Instructions:

Clone or download this repository.
Create a virtual environment (recommended) for managing dependencies.
Install required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt (if provided).
Run the Jupyter Notebook (sentiment_analysis.ipynb or similar) to explore the code and analysis process.
Project Overview
This project typically follows these steps:

Data Collection: Gather text data for analysis, such as reviews, social media posts, or survey responses.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the text data by removing noise, converting to lowercase, stemming/lemmatization (optional), etc.
Feature Engineering: Extract features from the text data that can be used for sentiment classification (e.g., word counts, sentiment lexicons).
Model Training: Train a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine) to classify sentiment based on the features.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
Analysis & Visualization: Analyze the results and visualize sentiment distribution.
Note: This is a general outline, and specific implementations may vary.
